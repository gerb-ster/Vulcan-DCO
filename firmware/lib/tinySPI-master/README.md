## Description
*tinySPI* is an Arduino SPI master library for ATtiny microcontrollers that utilizes the USI hardware in the ATtiny MCUs. Supported MCUs include ATtiny24/44/84, 25/45/85, 261/461/861, 2313/4313.

Because the USI hardware is not as sophisticated as the dedicated SPI hardware in the ATmega MCUs, *tinySPI* is more limited than the [standard Arduino SPI library](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPI) but still has several advantages over software bit-bang approaches.

As compared to the [Arduino shiftOut() function](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/ShiftOut), *tinySPI*

- is about 15 times faster,
- has a smaller program memory footprint, and
- has a consistent bit clock period.
 
*tinySPI* does not support

- sending the least-significant bit first,
- SPI data modes 2 and 3, or
- user-selectable SPI clock frequencies.
 
*tinySPI* will generate an SPI bit clock that is about one-tenth the MCU system clock frequency. For example, given a 1MHz system clock, the SPI clock will be about 100kHz, and it will take about 80Î¼s to transfer one byte. 

Interrupts are inhibited during each byte transfer to ensure a consistent bit clock period.

Included with the library are example sketches that demonstrate driving a 74HC595 shift register from an ATtiny84 and from an ATtiny85.

*tinySPI* has been tested with [Arduino 1.8.5](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and the [ATTiny Core](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore/).

## Methods
* begin()
* end()
* setDataMode()
* transfer()

### begin()
##### Description
Initializes the SPI bus, sets the USCK and DO pins to outputs, sets the DI pin to input.
##### Syntax
SPI.begin();
##### Parameters
None.
##### Returns
None.

### end()
##### Description
Disables the SPI bus (leaving the pin modes unchanged).
##### Syntax
SPI.end();
##### Parameters
None.
##### Returns
None.

### setDataMode()
##### Description
Sets the SPI data mode, i.e. clock polarity and phase. See the [Wikipedia article on SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus#Clock_polarity_and_phase) for details.
##### Syntax
SPI.setDataMode(mode)
##### Parameters
mode: SPI_MODE0 or SPI_MODE1 (modes 2 and 3 are not supported)
##### Returns
None.

### transfer()
##### Description
Transfers one byte over the SPI bus, both sending and receiving. Interrupts are inhibited during each byte transfer to ensure a consistent bit clock period.
##### Syntax
SPI.transfer(val);
##### Parameters
val: the byte to send over the bus _(byte)_
##### Returns
the byte read from the bus _(byte)_
